## Overview
SantoriniAI aims to create a website where users can play the board game Santorini against a friend locally or against some of our trained AIâ€™s. Our team aims to learn the basics of various AI algorithms that allow computers to play games intelligently. This includes the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, Monte Carlo Tree Search and possibly Deep-Q Network. Each bot will be available to challenge and play against on our website. More info can be found on the game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini_(game) 

## Motivation
Due to the lack of popularity, Santorini is largely "unsolved" game. There hasn't been a lot of discoveries with the new game.
